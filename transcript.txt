Welcome to another Speak English With Me video. Most of you guys already know how this works. For the new people here, I'll explain. But first of all, thank you for joining us. So, you will basically speak English with me. We will have a dialogue where one line will be mine and the next one will be yours. I'm going to say my line and then you will read your line from the screen out loud as if you were answering me. And then vice versa. Today's dialogue will be a dialogue between a landlord and a renter. We will be trying to rent an apartment. I think it's always a good idea to prepare yourself for different kinds of situations. So first, we will listen to the full dialogue and then proceed to the practicing part.

Good morning. How may I assist you?

Hi. I'm interested in renting an apartment.

Sure, we have some available units. What type of apartment are you looking for?

I'm looking for a one-bedroom apartment with a balcony and a parking spot.

Great. We have a few units that match your criteria. The rent for a one-bedroom apartment with a balcony and a parking spot is $1500 a month.

That sounds reasonable. What's included in the rent?

The rent includes water, trash, and maintenance services. You'll be responsible for paying your own electricity and gas.

I see. Can I take a look at the apartment before deciding to rent it?

Of course. We can schedule a showing at your convenience. When would you like to see the apartment?

How about this weekend?

Sure. We have availability on Saturday afternoon. Would that work for you?

Yes, that works for me.

If I decide to rent the apartment, what's the process?

You'll need to fill out an application and provide some documentation, such as your ID, proof of income, and references. Once we approve your application, we'll need a security deposit and the first month's rent to secure the apartment.

Understood. Thank you for your help. I'll schedule a showing for Saturday afternoon.

You're welcome. I look forward to showing you the apartment. If you have any other questions, feel free to ask.

All right. Let's practice. I'll go first. Good morning. How may I assist you?
